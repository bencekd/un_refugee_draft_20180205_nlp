GLOBAL COMPACT FOR SAFE, ORDERLY AND REGULAR
MIGRATION
ZERO DRAFT
5 February 2018
We, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, meeting in Morocco on 10-11
December 2018, recalling the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and determined to make
an important contribution to enhanced cooperation on international migration in all its dimensions, have
adopted this Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration:
PREAMBLE
1. This Global Compact rests on the principles espoused in the Charter of the United Nations, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and core international human rights treaties, the United
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime including the Protocol to Prevent,
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children and the Protocol
against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, the International Labour Organization conventions on
promoting decent work and labour mobility, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the
Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the New
Urban Agenda.
2. Discussions about international migration at global level are not new. We recall the advances
made through the United Nations High-level Dialogues on International Migration and
Development in 2006 and 2013. We also recognize the Global Forum on Migration and
Development launched in 2007. These platforms paved the way for the New York Declaration
for Refugees and Migrants, through which we committed to elaborate a Global Compact for
Refugees and to adopt this Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, in two
separate processes.
3. As an input to the preparatory process for this Global Compact, we recognize the report of the
Secretary-General, “Making Migration Work for All”.
4. This Global Compact is a milestone in the history of the global migration dialogue. It is guided
by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and
informed by the Declaration of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and
Development adopted in October 2013.
5. This Global Compact presents a non-legally binding, cooperative framework that builds on the
commitments agreed upon by Member States in the New York Declaration for Refugees and
Migrants. It upholds the sovereignty of States and fosters international cooperation among all
actors on migration, acknowledging that no State can address migration alone. 
2
OUR VISION AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
6. This Global Compact expresses our collective commitment to improving cooperation on
international migration. Migration has been part of the human experience throughout history,
and we recognize that it can be a source of prosperity, innovation and sustainable development
in our globalized world. The majority of the more than a quarter billion migrants around the world
today travel, live and work in a safe, orderly and regular manner. But migration undeniably
affects our countries in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways.
7. It is crucial that international migration unites us rather than divides us. This Global Compact
sets out our common understanding, shared responsibilities and unity of purpose regarding
migration.
Common Understanding
8. This Global Compact is the product of an unprecedented review of evidence and data gathered
during an open, transparent and inclusive process. We shared our realities and heard diverse
voices, enriching and shaping our common understanding of this complex phenomenon. We
learned that migration is a defining feature of our globalized world, connecting societies within
and across all regions, making us all countries of origin, transit and destination. We recognize
that there is a continuous need for international efforts to strengthen our knowledge and analysis
of migration. We must gather and share more and better data. We must ensure that current and
potential migrants are fully informed about their options, rights and duties, while all our citizens
should have access to objective, clear information of the benefits and challenges migration
creates rather than misleading narratives.
Shared Responsibilities
9. This Global Compact offers a 360-degree vision of international migration and recognizes that
a comprehensive approach is needed to optimize the overall benefits of migration while
addressing risks and challenges for individuals and communities associated with it. No country
can address the challenges and opportunities of this global phenomenon on its own. We
acknowledge our shared responsibilities to one another as Member States of the United Nations
to address each other’s needs and concerns over migration, and an overarching responsibility
to protect the human rights of migrants and promote our security and prosperity.
10. In this context, this Global Compact aims to mitigate the adverse drivers and structural factors
that hinder people from building and maintaining sustainable livelihoods in their countries of
origin, and so compel them to seek a future elsewhere. It intends to reduce the risks and
vulnerabilities migrants face at different stages of migration by respecting, protecting and
fulfilling their human rights and providing them with care and assistance. It seeks to address
legitimate concerns of communities about migration and the demographic, economic, social and
environmental changes their societies are undergoing. It strives to create conducive conditions
that enable all migrants to enrich our societies through their human, economic and social
capacities, and thus facilitate their contributions to sustainable development at the global level.
Unity of Purpose
11. This Global Compact recognizes that migration works for all when it takes place in a wellinformed,
planned and consensual manner. We must make it possible for people to remain in
their own countries in safety and dignity. We must save lives and keep migrants out of harm’s
way. We must empower migrants to become full members of our societies, highlight their
contributions, and promote inclusion and social cohesion. We must generate greater 
3
predictability and certainty for States, communities and migrants alike. To achieve this, we
commit to facilitate and ensure safe, orderly and regular migration for the benefit of all.
12. Our success rests on the mutual trust and determination of States to implement the actionable
commitments contained in this Global Compact. We unite to address the challenges and
opportunities of migration in all its dimensions through shared responsibility and innovative
solutions. It is with this sense of common purpose that we take this historic step, fully aware that
the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is a milestone, but not the end to
our efforts. We commit to continue the multilateral dialogue at the United Nations through a
robust follow-up and review mechanism, ensuring that the words in this document translate into
actions for the benefit of millions of people in every region of the world.
13. In this context, we agree that this Global Compact rests on a set of guiding principles:
People-centred: The Global Compact carries a strong human dimension to it, inherent to the
migration experience itself. As a result, the Global Compact places individuals at its core.
International cooperation: The Global Compact is a non-legally binding document. Its authority
rests on its consensual nature, credibility, collective ownership, and joint implementation. This
cooperative framework recognizes that no State can effectively address migration on its own
due to the inherently transnational nature of the phenomenon.
National sovereignty: The Global Compact reaffirms the right of States to exert sovereign
jurisdiction with regard to national migration policy. It strengthens the capacity of States to
exercise their prerogatives responsibly as they determine the conditions under which nonnationals
may enter, reside and work on their territory.
Rule of law and due process: The Global Compact recognizes that respect for the rule of law
and due process is fundamental to all aspects of migration governance. This means that public
and private institutions and entities, the State, and persons themselves are accountable to laws
that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are
consistent with international law and standards.
Sustainable development: The Global Compact is guided by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, in line with its recognition that migration is a multidimensional reality of major
relevance for the sustainable development of countries of origin, transit and destination.
Human rights: The Global Compact is guided by international human rights law and standards.
By implementing the actionable commitments herein, we ensure effective respect, protection
and fulfilment of the human rights of all migrants, regardless of their status, across all stages of
the migration cycle.
Gender-responsive: The Global Compact ensures that the human rights of women, men, girls
and boys are respected at all stages of migration and that they are empowered as agents of
change. It places a particular focus on the empowerment of women and girls and recognizes
their leadership in order to move away from addressing female migrants primarily through a lens
of victimhood.
Child-sensitive: The Global Compact upholds the best interests of the child, at all times, as the
primary consideration in situations concerning girls and boys in the context of international
migration.
4
Whole-of-government approach: The Global Compact considers that migration is a
multidimensional reality that cannot be addressed by one government policy sector alone. To
develop and implement effective migration policies and practices, a whole-of-government
approach is needed to ensure horizontal and vertical policy coherence across all sectors of
government.
Whole-of-society approach: The Global Compact promotes broad multi-stakeholder
partnerships to address migration in all its dimensions by including migrants, diasporas, local
communities, civil society organizations, academia, the private sector, parliamentarians, trade
unions, National Human Rights Institutions, the media and other relevant actors in migration
governance.

policies
15. We commit to build a robust global evidence base on international migration by improving and
investing in the collection, analysis and dissemination of accurate, reliable, comparable data,
disaggregated by sex, age and migration status. We further commit to ensure this evidence
fosters research, guides well-informed and coherent policy-making and public discourse, and
allows for effective monitoring of the implementation of commitments over time.
In this regard, the following actions are instrumental:
a) Harmonize methodologies on collection, analysis and dissemination of migration-related
data and indicators to achieve international compatibility between national data systems,
including by agreeing on a baseline statistical definition of an international migrant, by
developing a set of standards to measure migrant flows and stocks, as well as to document
essential characteristics of migrants, migration status, drivers, patterns and trends, and by
including all major stakeholders and sources of data in the elaboration of a comprehensive
data strategy on migration
b) Develop a global programme on national capacities in data collection, analysis and
dissemination to share data, address data gaps and assess key migration trends, that
encourages collaboration between relevant actors at all levels, provides dedicated training
for government officials, financial support and technical assistance, leverages new data
sources, including big data, and is reviewed by the United Nations Statistical Commission
on a regular basis

sources, to produce migration-related statistics, while upholding the right to privacy and the
protection of personal data
h) Develop country-specific migration profiles to foster evidence-based policy development
through collecting and sharing data on all migration-relevant aspects, including on labour
market needs, demand and availability of skills, the economic and social impacts of
migration, remittance transfer costs, health, education, living and working conditions,
wages, as well as the needs of migrants and receiving communities
OBJECTIVE 2: Minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel people to leave
their country of origin
16. We commit to create conducive political, economic, social and environmental conditions for
people to lead peaceful, productive and sustainable lives in their own country and ensure that
desperation and deteriorating environments do not compel them to seek a livelihood elsewhere.

ways that support inclusive growth, opportunities, prosperity, decent work, and job creation
for local populations
h) Promote entrepreneurship, vocational training and skills development programmes, in line
with labour market needs and in cooperation with the private sector, with a view to reducing
youth unemployment and compensating brain drain in countries of origin
i) Strengthen collaboration between humanitarian and development actors, including by
promoting joint analysis, multi-donor approaches and multi-year funding cycles, in order to
develop long-term responses that increase protection, resilience and coping capacities of
populations, as well as economic and social self-reliance, and by ensuring these efforts
include migration considerations
j) Develop tailored migration schemes of various duration, including planned temporary and
permanent relocation, to facilitate migration as an adaptation strategy to slow-onset
environmental degradation related to the adverse effects of climate change, such as
desertification and sea level rise
k) Integrate displacement considerations into disaster preparedness strategies and establish
protocols with neighbouring countries to prepare for early warning, contingency planning,
stockpiling, coordination mechanisms, evacuation planning, reception and assistance
arrangements, and public information
l) Enhance humanitarian protection measures for cross-border disaster displaced persons,
including on admission, stay and situations where return is not possible, and expand
mechanisms for resilience and lasting solutions by harmonizing approaches at subregional
and regional levels
OBJECTIVE 3: Provide adequate and timely information at all stages of migration
17. We commit to strengthen our efforts to provide, make available and disseminate adequate,
timely, accessible, and transparent information on migration-related aspects for and between
States, communities and migrants by taking into account all stages of migration. We further
commit to use this information to develop migration policies that provide a high degree of
predictability and certainty for all actors involved.
In this regard, the following actions are instrumental:
a) Launch a centralized and publicly available website to share information on regular
migration options and employment opportunities for prospective and returning migrants,

pre-departure orientation trainings in countries of origin, in cooperation with local
authorities, consular representations, the private sector, academia, migrant and diaspora
organizations and civil society, to inform potential migrants about the challenges and
opportunities of migration, including on the risks and dangers involved in irregular migration
carried out through traffickers and smugglers
OBJECTIVE 4: Provide all migrants with proof of legal identity, proper identification and
documentation
18. We commit to equip migrants with proof of legal identity and other relevant documentation,
including birth, marriage and death certificates, at all stages of migration in order to end
statelessness and avoid other vulnerabilities. We further commit to ensure this documentation
allows all migrants to have access to services and exercise their human rights, and States can
identify a person’s nationality upon entry and for return.
In this regard, the following actions are instrumental:

free movement regimes, visa liberalization or multiple-country visas, and labour mobility
cooperation frameworks
c) Review and revise existing options and pathways for regular migration, with a view to
address labour market imbalances, demographic realities and development challenges and
opportunities, in accordance with local labour market demands and skills supply
d) Develop flexible rights-based and gender-responsive labour mobility schemes for migrants
at all skills levels, including temporary, seasonal, circular, and fast-track programmes in
areas of labour shortages, in accordance with local labour market needs and skills supply,

emergency situations, and other life-endangering circumstances, including by providing
humanitarian visas, private sponsorships, access to education for children, and temporary
work permits 
10
g) Facilitate family reunification for migrants at all skills levels by integrating provisions in
migration laws and policies that remove barriers to the realization of the right to family unity
and family life, including income requirements, language pre-tests, length of stay, and type
of status, as well as provide work authorization and access to social security and services
h) Involve local authorities and other relevant stakeholders, particularly the private sector and
trade unions, in effective skills-matching in the national economy, monitoring the local
labour market, identifying skills gaps, and defining required skills profiles
OBJECTIVE 6: Facilitate fair and ethical recruitment and safeguard conditions that ensure
decent work
20. We commit to review existing recruitment mechanisms to guarantee that they are fair and

them with international guidelines and best practices, and prohibit recruiters from charging
fees or related costs to the migrant worker in order to avoid debt bondage, exploitation and
forced labour, including by establishing mandatory, enforceable mechanisms for effective
regulation and monitoring of the recruitment industry
e) Establish partnerships with all relevant stakeholders, including employers and trade unions,
to ensure that prospective migrants are provided written contracts in a language they
understand and are aware of the regulations relating to international labour recruitment,
their rights and obligations in this regard, as well as the access to complaint and redress
mechanisms
f) Hold employers, recruiters, their subcontractors and suppliers accountable when they are
involved in human and labour rights violations, by ensuring that the roles and
responsibilities of all, both within the recruitment and employment processes, are clearly
outlined, thereby enhancing supply chain transparency with regard to decent work
conditions for migrants
g) Strengthen the enforcement of ethical recruitment and decent work norms and policies by
enhancing the abilities of labour inspectors and other authorities to better monitor
recruiters, employers and service providers in order to ensure that fair and ethical
recruitment, as well as decent work conditions apply in all sectors, in conformity with
international standards 
11
h) End the practice of tying work visas to a single employer or sponsor in order to prevent
violations of human rights and promote greater opportunities for decent work
i) Prohibit, through national legislation, non-State entities from confiscating or retaining travel
or identity documents, as well as work contracts from a migrant in order to prevent abuse
and exploitation, and allow migrants to fully exercise their human rights
j) Provide all migrant workers engaged in remunerated labour with the same rights and
protections extended to all workers, particularly by ensuring that migrants can exercise their
rights to just and favourable conditions of work, to be free from slavery, servitude, or forced
or compulsory labour, to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and to have the
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including by allowing
membership in trade unions, wage protection mechanisms, and establishing firewalls with
labour inspections in cases of exploitation
k) Review national labour laws, employment policies and programmes to ensure that they
include considerations of the specific needs and contributions of female migrant workers,
including in domestic work, and adopt specific measures to prevent and address female
and male exploitation as a basis to promote gender-responsive labour mobility policies
OBJECTIVE 7: Address and reduce vulnerabilities in migration

identify individual, group-based or prima facie vulnerabilities, deliver timely and effective
referral, provide protection and specialized assistance, as well as to determine status,
ensuring all migrants are able to access appropriate protection of their human rights and
that the situation of each person is individually assessed
d) Establish robust procedures in all legislative, administrative and judicial proceedings and
decisions, as well as in all migration policies and programmes that are relevant to and have
an impact on children, including consular protection policies and services, to ensure that
the principle of the best interests of the child is appropriately integrated, consistently
interpreted and applied
e) Protect unaccompanied and separated children at all stages of migration through the
establishment of specialized procedures for their identification, referral, care and family
reunification, and provide access to their rights to health, education, legal assistance and

as essential means to address their particular vulnerability 
12
f) Ensure migrant’s access to independent legal assistance and representation in legal
proceedings that affect them, including during any related judicial or administrative hearing,
in order to safeguard that all migrants, everywhere, are recognized as persons before the
law and that the delivery of justice is impartial and non-discriminatory

status due to legal and practical impediments in the country of destination, in order to
reduce precariousness of status and related vulnerabilities, including by establishing
firewalls between immigration enforcement and public services
h) Involve local authorities and stakeholders in the identification, referral and assistance of
migrants in a situation of vulnerability, including through agreements with national
protection bodies, legal aid and service providers, as well as the engagement of mobile
response teams
OBJECTIVE 8: Save lives and establish coordinated international efforts on missing migrants
22. We commit to save lives and prevent migrant deaths through joint search and rescue operations,
standardized collection and exchange of information. We further commit to identify those who
have died or gone missing, and to facilitate communication with affected families.
In this regard, the following actions are instrumental:
a) Develop procedures and agreements on search and rescue with the primary objective to
protect migrants’ right to life that refrain from pushbacks at land and sea borders and
enhance reception and assistance capacities, while ensuring that the provision of
humanitarian assistance for migrants is never criminalized
b) Review the impacts of migration-related policies and laws to ensure that these do not raise
or create the risk of migrants going missing, including in the context of large movements of
persons who may use unsafe or irregular pathways, by working with relevant international
organizations and between States to identify contextual risks, gaps and actionable
solutions for preventing and responding to such situations
c) Enable migrants to inform their families without delay that they are alive by facilitating
access to means of communication along routes and at their destination, including in places
of detention, as well as access to consular missions, local authorities and organizations
that can provide assistance with family contacts, especially in cases of unaccompanied
migrant children
d) Establish transnational coordination channels and designate contact points for families
looking for missing migrants, through which families can be kept informed on the status of
the search, while respecting international data protection standards
e) Collect, centralize and systematize data regarding corpses and ensure traceability after
burial, in accordance with internationally accepted forensic standards, and establish
coordination channels at transnational level to facilitate immediate or future identification
and the provision of information to families 
13
OBJECTIVE 9: Strengthen the transnational response to smuggling of migrants
23. We commit to intensify joint efforts to prevent and counter smuggling of migrants, ensure that
smuggled migrants are not criminalized, and that they have access to protection and assistance,

vulnerabilities faced by smuggled migrants, and other relevant data to dismantle the
smuggling networks and enhance joint responses
c) Develop protocols along migration routes, consistent with international law, that outline
step-by-step measures to identify smuggled migrants and victims of aggravated smuggling,
provide access to protection and assistance for those in situations of vulnerability, as well
as facilitate cross-border law enforcement and intelligence cooperation to prevent
smuggling of migrants, increase conviction rates and end impunity for smugglers
d) Ensure that national legislation reflects irregular entry as an administrative, not a criminal
offence, penalizes smugglers where they have a financial or material benefit, and enhances
penalties for smuggling of migrants under aggravated circumstances, in accordance with
international law
e) Amend migration policies and procedures to distinguish between the crimes of smuggling
of migrants and trafficking in persons by using the correct definitions and applying distinct
responses to these separate crimes
OBJECTIVE 10: Prevent and combat trafficking in persons in the context of international
migration
24. We commit to reduce legal and practical barriers to preventing and combating trafficking in
persons in the context of international migration by strengthening international cooperation and
ending impunity of trafficking networks. We further commit to enhance the identification and
protection of, and assistance to migrants who have become victims of trafficking.
